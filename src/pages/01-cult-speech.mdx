{ /* Q: rewrite to focus the whole thing on the family international? */ }

{ /* TODO: not all cults treat their members like this? */}
Shouts echo across the bunks. Sunlight from the crack of dawn seeps through the windows. Another day of torture begins. It's been a year since you've left the compound, and you don't think you ever will again. 

Everyday, across the glove, thousands of men and women wake up to the same situation - trapped in a cycle ofdebilitating abuse and egregious psychological manipulation. These groups are called cults, and through targetting those at their lowest, they have recruited over a million members across the glove and forced them into being cut off from our world, and { /* TODO: if we mention sexual abuse here, is it well introduced in the next paragraph */ }sexually abused and manipulated.  However, the most insidious, mallicious thing these groups do is take in children. Young minds are very malleable, easily exploitable and able to be indoctrinated with malicious and ignorant ideas that can affect them through their whole life.

{ /* is for example correct here */ }
To truly understand cults, we have to look inside of one. For example, the Family International (formerly known as the Children of God). Founded in 1968, it spread across the world in the '70s. However, it has one disgusting, truly insidious secret - sexual abuse. Its founder, David Berg, claims that love and sex are for everyone and every age. This is horrendously wrong. This is horrendously inappropriate. This is horrendously unjust, immoral and unacceptable. We simply cannot stand by as this issue continues to grow and infect our society. We have to protect those who are too young to protect themselves. 

Not only are children being forced in after their parents are recruited, but babies are being born into this hell too. According to author Don Lattin, in his book "Jesus Freaks", over 13,000 children were born between 1971 and 2001, saying that mothers "with six, eight, ten, thirteen kids were not uncommon".  The cause of this is "Flirty Fishing". This was a method of "evangilism" used by female members of Berg's cult. They would lure men in and recruit them using sexual appeal - a truly disturbing tactic. 

Lastly, these issues that lie in deep emotional scars left in these children don't just wash away - they are there forever. Fear of the outside world, fear of the unknown, fear of the future. Many are left with undiagnosed mental illnesses, and turn to drugs to cope. This is a cycle that needs to be broken. We need to protect the children of the world from these insidious, malicious groups. We cannot tolerate this level of abuse, where children are pulled from their beds in the middle of the night as part of a "sharing schedule", where they are groped and raped by David Berg, and brutally beaten if they have a "poor performance". 

We must create a better world for the future of our planet.
